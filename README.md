- GitHub Actions workflow with log retention for 14 days
- Email alert for workflow failures using SMTP

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-actions-python-logging.git
   cd github-actions-python-logging
2.	Add Secrets to GitHub Repo
o	EMAIL_USERNAME: Your email (e.g., Gmail)
o	EMAIL_PASSWORD: App password
